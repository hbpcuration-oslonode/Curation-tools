In order to share your research data through the Human Brain Project, your datasets need to be organized in a way that makes it easy for people to browse and understand your data. This is to ensure that your data are reusable.

Once you consider your datasets well organized, the HBP Curation Team will review the folder structure of each dataset to make sure that it fulfills the data organization requirements of the HBP. To make this review process easier, we provide a small script that automatically scans your dataset folder and saves the results in a text file, which you can then send back to us.



## Usage:

1. Download the script for your system:
   - For Windows, use **FolderStructure.bat**
   - For Unix-based systems, including Mac, use **FolderStructure.sh**
   - To save from GitHub, click the file name, select **Raw** in the upper right corner of the text box that appears, and press Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S) to save the file. Keep the original file name and format.
2. Copy the file into your dataset folder (top level). If you have multiple datasets, you'll have to repeat these steps for each of them.
3. Double-click the script within your dataset folder to run it.
4. A new text file will be created for each dataset in the same folder: FolderStructure-xxxxxx-yyyyyy.txt. This is a text file describing your folder structure.
5. Please send the text file back to us as part of the HBP curation process.
